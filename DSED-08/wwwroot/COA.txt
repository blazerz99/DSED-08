Heading How it all started
This all started when our founder won the lottery and he decided to build a shelter for pets. 
We are only a team of 8 but we have a lot of business partners accross the world working with us to help animals everywhere like help a paw and other animal saving groups. 
Our organisation runs on donations from the people and our daycare section of the business. 
We are currently a new up and coming shelter that started a few months ago and is slowly growing
Heading Other Groups
We work together with a lot of different group to help animals around the world. 
we strive to do  our best in taking care of pets, but we wont be 
able to do this without your help.
For now we only have a daycare center for pets whose owner have to leave them to

With the help of other organisations and groups internationally we aim to be able to 
let people around the world adopt a pet from anywhere not just in New Zealand.
